# Portfolio

This is my personal web development portfolio. It is meant to supplement my resume and showcase my abilities to build and design modern web applications as well as some of my past job experiences. There is a landing page, timeline and list of projects. The projects will link to where they are hosted or to their github repository. 

It was built with Angular 7 and is hosted [here](www.chriscastor.com)
