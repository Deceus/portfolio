                <p>
                    After 4 years of budget reports and government work, I have reignited my passion for web developement this
                    time with a more modern touch. I started with modern Javascript (ES6+) along with babel and webpack. From
                    there I took a dive into HTML5/CSS3 web design to start with a great foundation for learning the modern
                    Javascript frameworks. I started with Angular 7 and have been tranisitioning into React to round out my
                    front-end toolkit before moving on to become a Full-Stack developer.

                    In March of 2019 I graduated the Big Nerd Ranch Full-Stack + React 5 day bootcamp. The program covered 
                    setting up a KOA server for a basic chat app, authenication with passport and persistence with MongoDB.
