        <p>
          After 4 years of budget reports and government work, I have reignited my passion for web developement this
          time with a more modern touch. I started with modern Javascript (ES6+) along with babel and webpack. From
          there I took a dive into HTML5/CSS3 web design to start with a great foundation for learning the modern
          Javascript frameworks. I started with Angular 7 and have been tranisitioning into React to round out my
          front-end toolkit before moving on to become a Full-Stack developer.
